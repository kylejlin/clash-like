# clash-like
My first attempt at Clash-of-Clans-like (a.k.a. "pixel perfect") touch controls.

If your device has a touchscreen, you can see a demo [here](https://kylejlin.github.io/clash-like).

# Code
Yep, the code is a mess.
Sorry.

# Known bugs
If the window height is greater than the window width (i.e., the device is in portrait mode), then only the top portion of the screen is responsive.
